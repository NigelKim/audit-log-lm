## Installation
Use `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the required packages. If updated ` pipreqs . --savepath
requirements.txt --ignore Sophia` to update.

## Usage
Before the model can be used the configuration needs to be updated. A skeleton YAML file is provided in
[`config_template.yaml`](config_template.yaml) and should be copied to `config.yaml` and updated.

The vocab for this project is generated using `python vocab.py`, and can be run once `config.yaml` is updated.

The model can be run using `python train.py`. The dataset will be cached for a ~25x reduction in the amount of data used which will enable it to load faster. If needed `--reset_cache` can be used to overwrite the old data.

The entropy over the test or validation set can be evaluated using `python entropy.py`. You'll be prompted with the list of models you've trained. Entropy as it relates to other measures can be evaluated using `python entropy.py --exp "exp1,exp2,...,expn"`.
